# Mars Rover Project
Introduction
The following is a fun coding project that we would like you to complete. It should be considered an opportunity to demonstrate your creativity, problem solving and ability to think outside the box.

Problem
A squad of robotic rovers are to be landed by NASA on a plateau on Mars. This plateau, which is curiously rectangular, must be navigated by the rovers so that their on-board cameras can get a complete map of the surrounding terrain to send back to Earth.
A rover's position and location are represented by a combination of x and y coordinates and a letter representing one of the four cardinal compass points. The plateau is divided up into a grid to simplify navigation. An example position might be 0, 0, N, which means the rover is in the bottom left corner and facing North.
In order to control a rover, NASA sends a simple string of letters. The possible letters are 'L', 'R' and 'M'. 'L' and 'R' makes the rover spin 90 degrees left or right respectively, without moving from its current spot. 'M' means move forward one grid point and maintain the same heading.
Assume that the square directly North from (x, y) is (x, y+1).

Additional Information
It is assumed that the first action is to define the size of the Plateau.
Once complete rover objects can be deployed within the plateau, each rover should be able to take a series of commands following the simple letter commands outlined above.
In the test we will be providing a movements.csv, this file will outline each rover and it’s predefined movements, this information should be sent to the plateau to automate the process of mapping the surroundings.
Each rover should be sequential, meaning the second rover will only complete its tasks once the rover before it has finished moving.
Additional rovers can optionally be added with the ability to define both starting location and movements.
Each line in the movements.csv file represents an independent rover, these lines are then split by a pipe, on the left of the pipe is the rover starting position and on the right of the pipe is the rover's movements.

****************************************
Movements File (For Reference)

1 2 N|LMLMLMLMM
3 3 E|MMRMMRMRRM

## Technical
The project moves the initial rover when. It has option to load CSV and move all the rovers sequentially until finished.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
